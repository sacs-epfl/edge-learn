Cloud probably slower because of I/O bottleneck

If I have 8 clients each with its own DataLoader then
it is quicker then having the cloud with 1 DataLoader.
I did an experiment of measuring the time and the time 
 for getting 256 in the cloud was 1.6 but when doing
 hybrid it takes 3.4 but to get 512
