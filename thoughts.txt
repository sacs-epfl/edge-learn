Cloud probably slower because of I/O bottleneck

If I have 8 clients each with its own DataLoader then
it is quicker then having the cloud with 1 DataLoader.
So if we have 8 clients we essentially have 8 data loaders working on 
    different parts of the data. Meanwhile the cloud was left with only 1,
    the solution is to give the cloud more data_workers which cuts time down
    dramatically! From 1.6 seconds to 0.14 with 8 data workers
